- [Timeline 3d](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timeline-3d/id929188617?mt=12)
	- Desktop app, claims no limitations, but has some in-app purchase options
- [SmartDraw](https://www.smartdraw.com/)
	- For making lots of different kinds of diagrams
	- $10/mo
- [Timestream](https://ntrepidcorp.com/products/timestream/?utm_source=preceden&utm_campaign=timeline-makers)
	- Strong [[Palantir Gotham]] vibes
	- Doesn't list pricing; I'm guessing it's high-touch with bespoke pricing like Palantir
- [Tiki Toki](https://www.tiki-toki.com/)
	- Beautiful
	- But very limited in the number of timelines you can make, even with paid accounts
- [ChronoFlo Timeline Maker](https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/)
	- Looks great, great UX
	- Paid account needed to embed on personal site
	- No private option in the free tier?
	- Only one timeline available on the free tier
- [Cascade.page](https://github.com/kochrt/cascade.page)
	- [Demo site](https://cascade.page/)
	- Text-to-timeline 
	- Looks like it's missing multimedia support
- [http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/](http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/)
	- Desktop app
	- Source code available
	- Looks like it's intended to edit and consume timelines within the app, not on the web
- [HistoryTimeLine](https://www.historytimeline.com/)
	- Focused at historians
	- Desktop app, no Mac version available
- [ChronoZoom](http://www.chronozoom.com/)
	- Really neat treemap kind of view for cosmic and geologic time scales
	- Not useful for family history kind of timelines
- [Time.graphics](https://time.graphics/)
	- Really great looking
	- Supports download and export
	- Lots of options for managing placement, styling
	- But relatively expensive ($18.90/mo)
	- Free tier is extremely limited
- [Aeon Timeline](https://timeline.app/)
	- Focused on creative writing, project management
	- Desktop app
	- $65 for a five-device, permanent license
	- Can't tell if it exports to web or not
- [Liniaa](https://www.liniaa.com/)
	- Intended for documenting your personal life, which is kind of perfect for my use case
	- But it was a commercial endeavor, and they couldn't get enough paid users, so it's shut down and has free tier available only
	- Can't tell if there's any way to export, and I'm not going to put a ton of effort into something that might just disappear
- [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)
	- Technically TimelineJS3, I guess
	- Super easy to get started
	- But I'm having some styling difficulties - can't get it to go full screen
	- Also it lets you view a single headline at a time, and doesn't appear to render media on the timeline, which is a great feature I'd like.
- [Preceden](https://www.preceden.com/)
- [timepath](https://timepath.co/)
	- Doesn't support spans, only point-in-time
	- Only headline view
- [Timeline Maker Pro](https://www.timelinemaker.com/)
	- Focused on investigations and project planning
- [Timetoast](https://www.timetoast.com/)
	- Looks like point-in=time timelines, no spans
	- Thumbnails on the timeline, that's nice
	- No free tier
- [Timelines Chart](https://github.com/vasturiano/timelines-chart)
	- D3js component
	- No multimedia support that I can tell
	- No scrolling; all one view
- [d3-timeline](https://github.com/jiahuang/d3-timeline)
	- Simple timeline component for d3
	- Not suitable for our needs
- [AMCHARTS timeline](https://www.amcharts.com/timeline-chart/)
	- Very cool, but too slick and not feature rich enough
	- Paid
- [Vis.js](https://visjs.org/) timeline component
	- Actually, that's in the running
	- Looks very flexible, supports both point-in-time and spans
	- Supports more levels than TimelineJS
	- Can be made to support media on the items
	- Can be edited inline - maybe could then export the data to a file?
- [patternfly-timeline](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-timeline)
	- Looks more like it's intended for analysis than just perusal
- [Timemapper](https://github.com/okfn/timemapper)
	- Make timelines and maps that sync up
	- Not a good fit, I don't think
	- Looks like it might use TimelineJS under the hood - the UI is almost the same
- [Timelinesetter](https://propublica.github.io/timeline-setter/)
	- more for organizing news by date than organizing lots of things on a timeline
	- 


Examples:
- [Timelines Chart](https://bl.ocks.org/vasturiano/ded69192b8269a78d2d97e24211e64e0)
	- Uses the [timelines-chart](https://github.com/vasturiano/timelines-chart) d3js component
	- It would be interesting to see how our timelines would look with that kind of chart, but it's not ultimately what I'm looking for.
- [Melbourne 2020 timeline](https://observablehq.com/@didoesdigital/2020-timeline)
	- Some good stuff, but all point-in-time, no media
- [D3.js Timeline.v2](https://codepen.io/chris-creditdesign/pen/nKoRaZ)
	- I like the stacking-without-overlapping look better
- [Phillosophers timeline](http://igncp-demos.herokuapp.com/d3js/timeline)
	- I like this one, though we'd have to add in support for popups and media
