# Summary
Work for hire is a work where the employer owns the copyright, not the creator of the work.

# Notes
When you're an independent contractor being hired to make something, most of the time you retain copyright to what you produce. Work for hire is an exception. A "work made for hire" is an exception. According to the United States Copyright Act of 1976, it's [^1]

> (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a [collective work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_work_(US) "Collective work (US)"), as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. (17 U.S.C. § 101)

And if it's created by an independent contractor, it must further satisfy all of

> -   the work must come within one of the nine limited categories of works listed in the definition above, namely (1) a contribution to a collective work, (2) a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, (3) a translation, (4) a supplementary work, (5) a compilation, (6) an instructional text, (7) a test, (8) answer material for a test, (9) an atlas;
> -   the work must be specially ordered or commissioned;
> -   there must be a written agreement between the parties specifying that the work is a work made for hire by use of the phrase "work for hire" or "work made for hire."[^2]
