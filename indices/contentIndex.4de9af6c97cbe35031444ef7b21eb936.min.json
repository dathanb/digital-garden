Even at Palantir, many of the pieces we built policy around rather than attempting to automate\n\u003e \n\u003e    short version though is:  \n\u003e \n\u003e -   figure out why you're doing this. It was literally thousands of hours of engineering time for Palantir (but we also had a complex product and little compliance experience). If it's a customer, what's the level at which you need to be approved (low, moderate, high). That will determine the set of controls\n\u003e -   Figure out if you're going JAB (joint authorization board) or agency approval. JAB is typically more stringent and takes much longer (backlog was 1-2 years when I last checked a couple years ago), but their approval is mostly accepted across the whole gov. In either case, you need actual federal customers seeking to use your product, otherwise you're at the back of the line\n\u003e -   Find a 3PAO (third party audit org) that you can work with. They'll be the people you have to convince of the adequacy of your controls. If they don't have a technical bone in their collective body, tech solutions are going to be a hard sell.\n\u003e -   Build your compliance package. That largely means control responses to the subset of [NIST 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final) controls applicable for your security baseline\n\u003e -   iterate\n\u003e -   get audited\n\u003e -   Audit gets  reviewed by the FedRAMP authorization authority selected in step 2 (this too requires iteration and explaining things to non-technical people. Here is where paying for a good 3PAO who can defend your solution / their assessment really pays)\n\u003e -   profit?","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.195116149Z","tags":null},"/Links":{"title":"","content":"- Chords-db: https://github.com/tombatossals/chords-db","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.195116149Z","tags":null},"/Microformats":{"title":"","content":"# Summary\nMicroformats are HTML for marking up people, organizations, etc.\n\n# Links\n- http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page\n- [People and Organizations schema](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card)\n\n# Notes\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.195116149Z","tags":null},"/Mountain-View-Optometry":{"title":"","content":"\nhttp://www.mvo.com/\n\nAlso appears to be accessible via https://www.weo5.com/p/Home-p22156.asp","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.195116149Z","tags":null},"/Nethack":{"title":"","content":"\nhttps://www.nethack.org/","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.195116149Z","tags":null},"/Palantir":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.195116149Z","tags":null},"/Social-Security":{"title":"","content":"\n\n# Spousal Benefit\n\nWhen a worker files for retirement benefits, the worker's spouse may be eligible for a benefit based on the worker's earnings.[^1]\n\n[^1]: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/spouse.html","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.203116188Z","tags":null},"/Steramine":{"title":"","content":"If you go to Google and search for Steramine, you get tablets as a result. e.g., [this result from Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Steramine-Quaternary-Sanitizing-Surfaces-Sanitizer/dp/B08BPM19XD)\n\nThe prouct label lists\nActive Incredient: (Quaternary) Alkyl (C14.95% C12.3% C16.2%) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride dihydrate 50%\nOther ingredients: 50%\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.203116188Z","tags":null},"/TF-IDF":{"title":"","content":"**Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency** is a type of [[Embeddings|Embedding]] used for [[Text similarity]] calculation.\n\n# Links\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) \n- [Fast and Memory-efficient TFIDF Calculation for Text Analysis of Large Datasets](https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1183\u0026context=computersci_fac)\n\t- Introduces \"List of Lists (LIL)\" as alternative to \"Compressed Sparse Row\" representation\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.203116188Z","tags":null},"/Text-similarity":{"title":"","content":"# Links\n- [Overview of text similarity approaches on Medium](https://medium.com/@adriensieg/text-similarities-da019229c894)","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T00:48:32.203116188Z","tags":null},"/The-Fifth-Season-N.K.-Jemisin":{"title":"","content":"\n\u003carticle class=\"hentry\"\u003e\n  \u003ch1 class=\"entry-title\"\u003eThe Fifth Season\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eAuthor: \u003cspan class=\"author vcard\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e[[N.K.
